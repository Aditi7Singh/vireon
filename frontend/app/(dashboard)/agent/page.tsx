  "Show me our current runway and burn rate": `**Runway & Burn Analysis — April 2026**

📊 **Current Position**
• Cash & Equivalents: **₹2.84 Cr** (HDFC + ICICI + Kotak)
• Monthly Gross Burn: **₹48.1L**
• Monthly Net Burn: **₹37.2L** (after ₹10.9L revenue)
• **Runway: 7.6 months** at current burn rate

⚠️ **Risk Factors**
• Cooley LLP bill of ₹1.87L is 15 days overdue — pays immediately reduces runway by 4 days
• AWS spend trending +12% QoQ — optimization could save ₹1.5L/month
• Payroll bump in June (+2 hires) will increase burn by ~₹4.2L/month

✅ **Positive Signals**
• MRR grew 21% last month (₹8.9L → ₹10.8L), reducing net burn each month
• Burn multiple: 0.82× (excellent for growth stage — industry median 1.4×)
• Gross margin improved to 68% from 61% QoQ

**Recommendation:** At current MRR growth, you reach cash-flow positive in ~5.2 months. Maintain hiring plan but defer opex >₹5L until Q3 FY27.`,

  "Which invoices are overdue and how much?": `**Overdue Invoice Summary — April 27, 2026**

🔴 **2 Invoices Overdue**

| Invoice | Customer | Amount | Days Overdue | Risk |

| INV-2026-042 | Nexus Ventures | ₹6.0L | 18 days | High |
| INV-2026-038 | Bloom Health | ₹3.2L | 7 days | Medium |

**Total Overdue AR: ₹9.2L** (DSO: 38 days vs. industry 30)

**Suggested Actions**
1. Send payment reminder to Nexus (historically slow — avg 45 DSO)
2. Bloom Health has not opened the email — resend with read receipt
3. Consider adding 1.5%/month late fee clause in next contract renewal

**Upcoming Risk:** INV-2026-047 (TechCorp · ₹8.4L) due in 12 days with no payment confirmation.

  "Forecast our 12-month runway under base case": `**12-Month Runway Forecast — Base Case (Apr 2026 → Mar 2027)**

📈 **Assumptions (Base Case)**
• MRR Growth: +15% MoM tapering to +8% by Q4

  "What's our MRR growth trend this quarter?": `**MRR Growth Analysis — Q4 FY26 (Jan–Apr 2026)**

📊 **MRR Trajectory**

| Month | MRR | MoM Growth | New ARR | Churned ARR |
|-------|-----|------------|---------|-------------|
| Jan 2026 | ₹7.2L | — | ₹1.4L | ₹0.3L |
| Feb 2026 | ₹8.1L | +12.5% | ₹1.8L | ₹0.2L |
| Mar 2026 | ₹9.3L | +14.8% | ₹2.1L | ₹0.3L |

• Net Revenue Retention: 118% (expansion > churn — excellent)
• Quick Ratio: 3.2 (new MRR / churned MRR — world-class at >4 target)

⚠️ **Watch Items**
• Churn ticked up to ₹0.4L in April — investigate if pattern continues
• 3 customers on month-to-month contracts representing ₹1.8L MRR

**Projection:** At current growth rate, MRR reaches ₹18.5L by Sep 2026, implying ARR of ₹2.22 Cr. This supports a Series A at ~6–8× ARR (₹13–18 Cr valuation).`,

  "List all bills pending my approval": `**Bills Pending Approval — April 27, 2026**

⏳ **4 Bills Awaiting Your Review**

| # | Vendor | Description | Amount | Due Date | Priority |
|---|--------|-------------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | AWS India | April cloud compute | ₹71,400 | Apr 30 | 🔴 Urgent |

  "How does our gross margin compare to budget?": `**Gross Margin vs Budget Analysis — FY26 YTD**

📊 **Performance vs Budget**

| Month | Actual GM% | Budget GM% | Variance | Revenue |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Apr 2025 | 61.2% | 63.0% | −1.8pp | ₹6.8L |
| Jul 2025 | 64.1% | 64.5% | −0.4pp | ₹9.2L |
| Oct 2025 | 66.8% | 65.0% | **+1.8pp** | ₹11.4L |
| Jan 2026 | 67.4% | 65.5% | **+1.9pp** | ₹8.9L |
| Apr 2026 | **68.3%** | 66.0% | **+2.3pp** | ₹10.8L |

✅ **Above Budget by 2.3pp** — driven by:
• AWS reserved instance savings (−₹1.2L/month)
• Software seat optimization (removed 12 unused Figma seats)
• Increased high-margin professional services mix (+8pp of revenue)

⚠️ **Risk:** If enterprise deals >₹5L slow down, services mix drops and GM% could dip to ~65%.

**Full Year Budget:** 66.0% · **Projected Full Year:** 68.1% → **beat by ~210bps**`,

  "Show payroll breakdown by department": `**Payroll Breakdown by Department — April 2026**

| Department | Headcount | Monthly CTC | Take-Home | PF (Co.) | TDS Est. |
|------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Engineering | 8 | ₹18.4L | ₹12.8L | ₹2.2L | ₹2.1L |
| Product | 2 | ₹4.2L | ₹2.9L | ₹0.5L | ₹0.5L |

  "Model impact of hiring 5 engineers in June": `**Hiring Impact Model — 5 Engineers joining June 2026**

⚙️ **Assumptions**
• Average CTC: ₹18L/year (₹1.5L/month each)
• Total cost (CTC + PF + equipment + onboarding): ₹1.74L/month/hire
• Ramp time to full productivity: 90 days
• Revenue impact: +₹8L/month new capacity by Sep 2026

📊 **Impact Analysis**

| Metric | Before Hire | After Hire | Change |
|--------|------------|------------|--------|
| Monthly Gross Burn | ₹48.1L | ₹56.8L | **+₹8.7L** |
| Net Burn (Jun) | ₹37.2L | ₹45.9L | **+₹8.7L** |
| Runway (current cash) | 7.6 months | **6.2 months** | −1.4 months |
| Revenue/employee | ₹60K/mo | ₹49K/mo | −18% (temporary) |
| Projected Revenue/emp (Dec) | — | ₹72K/mo | Recovery by Q3 |

⚠️ **Cash Impact:** Runway drops from 7.6 to 6.2 months — **series A process should begin immediately** to maintain safe runway buffer.

✅ **Strategic Case:** 5 engineers enables delivery of 3 enterprise features scheduled for Q3, which supports 2 pipeline deals worth ₹24L ARR. NPV positive at discount rate 20%.

**Recommendation:** Hire 3 in June, 2 in August to smooth burn impact.`,

  "Analyze our cash position and flag risks": `**Cash Position & Risk Analysis — April 27, 2026**

💰 **Bank Balances**

| Account | Bank | Balance | Usage |
|---------|------|---------|-------|
| Operating | HDFC Current | ₹1.42 Cr | Day-to-day ops |
| Payroll | ICICI Salary | ₹68.4L | Monthly payroll |
| Reserve | Kotak FD | ₹74.2L | Emergency buffer |
| **Total** | | **₹2.84 Cr** | |

📊 **Cash Flow at Risk (Monte Carlo — 10,000 simulations)**
• P10 (worst 10%): ₹1.2 Cr in 6 months
• P50 (median): ₹1.8 Cr in 6 months
• P90 (best 10%): ₹2.6 Cr in 6 months

🔴 **Critical Risks**
1. **Payroll reserve:** Only ₹68.4L — 1.8× monthly payroll. Maintain minimum 3× buffer (₹1.08 Cr)
2. **Single FD concentration:** ₹74.2L in Kotak — consider laddering across 3 banks for DICGC coverage
3. **AR concentration:** Top 3 customers = 61% of AR — Nexus Ventures payment ($6L) overdue 18d

✅ **Healthy Signals**
• Operating cash covers 2.9 months of burn (minimum acceptable: 3 months — borderline)
• No outstanding loans or credit lines — clean balance sheet for fundraising`,

  "Compare our unit economics to SaaS benchmarks": `**Unit Economics Benchmarking — Vireon vs SaaS Industry**

📊 **Key Metrics vs Benchmark**

| Metric | Vireon | Seed Stage Median | Series A Target | Status |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Gross Margin | 68.3% | 65% | 70%+ | ✅ Good |
| LTV:CAC Ratio | 3.8× | 3× | 5× | ✅ Good |
| CAC Payback | 8.2 months | 12 months | <9 months | ✅ Excellent |
| Net Revenue Retention | 118% | 105% | 120%+ | 🟡 Near Target |
| Quick Ratio | 3.2 | 2.5 | 4+ | 🟡 Improving |
| Burn Multiple | 0.82× | 1.5× | <1× | ✅ Excellent |
| Revenue/Employee | ₹60K/mo | ₹55K/mo | ₹80K/mo | 🟡 Room to grow |
| Magic Number | 0.74 | 0.5 | >1 | ✅ Good |

✅ **Standout Strengths:** CAC payback and burn multiple are world-class — strong capital efficiency story for investors.

📈 **Areas to Improve:**
• NRR needs expansion upsell motion (currently 118% — target 125%+)
• Revenue per employee grows naturally as ARR scales without proportional headcount

**Investor Narrative:** Vireon is in the top quartile of capital efficiency among Indian B2B SaaS. Lead with burn multiple (0.82×) and CAC payback (8.2mo) in fundraising materials.`,
